        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
        <div>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/rohanvuthuri/Individual-Projects/tree/main/Earthquake%20Prediction%20Model">Earthquake Prediction Model</a></h3>
            <p>November 2023</p>
            <p>Developed the model by analyzing the historical frequency of earthquakes datasets around the world. Utilized the NumPy library in Python to manage and clean data from dataset and use of Neural Network algorithm. Implemented with neural networks using the TensorFlow library in python to analyze the data and predict the next earthquake. Output from the model displays next predicted area by using Matplotlib library in Python.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/rohanvuthuri/Individual-Projects/blob/main/TextSummarizer.py">Text Summarizer</a></h3>
            <p>January 2024</p>
            <p>Developed the model to summarize and shorten the text from the user’s response by filtering unnecessary words. This is done by utilizing the NLTK library and “Stopwords” portion of the NLTK library in Python. Developed the interactive frontend by using the Tkinter library in Python.</p>
