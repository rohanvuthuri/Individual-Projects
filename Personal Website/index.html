            <h3>Earthquake Prediction Model</h3>
            <p>November 2023</p>
            <p>Developed the model by analyzing the historical frequency of earthquakes datasets around the world. Utilized the NumPy library in Python to manage and clean data from dataset and use of Neural Network algorithm. Implemented with neural networks using the TensorFlow library in python to analyze the data and predict the next earthquake. Output from the model displays next predicted area by using Matplotlib library in Python.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Text Summarizer</h3>
            <p>January 2024</p>
            <p>Developed the model to summarize and shorten the text from the user’s response by filtering unnecessary words. This is done by utilizing the NLTK library and “Stopwords” portion of the NLTK library in Python. Developed the interactive frontend by using the Tkinter library in Python.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Municipal Park Application</h3>
            <p>April 2024</p>
            <p>Developed an application for the Municipal Park in Blacksburg with 3 other people for Introduction in Human-Computer Interaction class. Created this application by using Swift and utilized the Apple Maps API into our application. This application was created to boost the engagement for the Municipal Park in Blacksburg and to make a user’s experience at Municipal Park better. Features include a map feature, by using the Apple Maps API, to guide a user to a specific spot in the park, a reporting feature for any suspicious activity around the park, and a booking feature to book a certain part of the park at a certain time.</p>
